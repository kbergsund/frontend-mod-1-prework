## Section 1 Reflection

- [x] How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I resonate with the SuperLearner Article because I have witnessed the results in my own learning of not following these habits. To elaborate, I didn't always eat healthy during undergrad and I can now look back and reflect on how it negatively impacted my focus, my confidence, and my critical thinking ability. Outside of that, I have aways prided myself on my work ethic and my enthusiasm for learning so from the very beginning, starting in middle school, I've been an avid reader and notetaker. Other items from the list I already do are treating learning as a process- I recognize that I will never be done learning and this energizes me -and teaching others. I really value collaborative learning and being able to answer questions for my peers.

Where I need to improve is, as I mentioned, eating well. I eat a lot healthier but can still get in a groove with work and skip lunch or afternoon snacking. Getting better at this will emerge directly out of my main item that I need to start doing, which is more frequent pom breaks. When I am invested in my work, I can go too long without looking or getting up. For my overall health- from sitting and staring at a screen to long breaks without food -walking away from the computer for 5-10 minutes in regular intervals will help a lot. I am considering getting a pomodoro-style app but will at least get in the habit of setting phone timers. Related to health, I also need to get to bed earlier. Finally, I need to get better at having a growth mindset and perspective. With a field as broad, specialized, advanced, and ever-evolving as programming, I can easily get overwhelmed that I will never be good enough, that I am starting too late, etc. This is a fixed mindset and is actively unproductive. I need to recenter the fact that I can do it and that everyone in the field is constantly growing. It is no less doable for me than it is for everyone else, and Turing is here to help me in the journey.

- [x] What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

We learned about three data types; strings, numbers, and booleans. Strings are anything in between quotation marks. I like to think of them as necklaces of characters. Numbers are numbers, fairly self-explanatory. Can be positive or negative but anything with a decimal is a 'floating point' number. Boolean is a data type with only two possible options, true or false. It essentially refers to a computer's ability to return yes or no. It is very helpful with situations of branching logic or two different paths depending on a result.

- [x] How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

&nbsp;
- [x] What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Use ``//`` for single-line comments or ``/* */`` for multi-line comments.Code comments are super helpful for explaining what code is doing- and potentially how. Essential for the reader- either yourself later on or a collaborator. The person writing can be as broad or as granular as necessary depending on need/complexity. Comments can also be used to de-activate portions of code which is helpful when drafting, editing, optimizing, etc.

&nbsp;
- [x] In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a way to store and represent information. Information is assigned a variable name and then- at any point in the script -we can employ that name to reference the information or even reassign new information to the variable name. Variables make writing code more versatile, readable, and efficient.

For a 5-year old, I would say: Picture that you have a bunch of multi-colored shelves for your toys. Each type of toy belongs on a different shelf: books are on a blue shelf, stuffed animals are on a red shelf, and LEGOs are on a green shelf. Later on, you specifically want to play with your stuffed animal dog. You know in your brain that you have to check your red shelf. So 'red shelf' would be your variable. You were able to reference the red shelf when you wanted to access the information about where your dog stuffed animal is.

&nbsp;
- [x] Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I frequently use Youtube. Two variables that are likely string data types are a person's username and something to represent the search bar. A video's views are likely stored in a variable as a number.

&nbsp;
- [x] In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation joins variables together. Javascript type coercion enables multiple different data types to seamlessly combine. Concatenation is as if pizzas were made by cooking each slice individually and then combining them at the end. The whole pie would be the concatenated data.

&nbsp;
- [x] Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I use Wine.com, which has many promos generate around the site. When you click them, it generates a pop-up with a bunch of unique information. Concatenation may be used to join the standard marketing copy with the unique, ever-changing promotional offer, promo code, and disclaimer copy/expiration date.

&nbsp;
- [x] What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

1. Why do we have both concatenation and interpolation? In which situations would you use one versus the other?
2. Curious about the different applications of '==' versus '==='. I read that the latter pays attention to data type, not sure when we would ever use '=='.
